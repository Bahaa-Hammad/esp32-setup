The task was performed in the smart methods office. 

The group received an esp32 from the office's advisor.

Step One: 
The group installed Arduino IDE through Arduino documentation.
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Step Two:
Integrating the Arduino IDE with esp32. All dependencies and needed libraries were installed by adding the following link in board management. 
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_ESP32_index.json
Then, searching for ESP32 in the board manager to start the installation process. 

Step Three: 
Connect to the esp32 by choosing the right serial port. 
In our situation, it was COM3. 

Step Four: 
Writing  Arduino code to control the LED on the esp32.
Used the code uploaded in the repository. 

Step Five: 
Uploading the code on esp32, and testing the code.
